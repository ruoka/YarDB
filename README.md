# YarDB - Yet Another RESTFul Database

Under Construction!

The intention of the project is to implement an easy to use document-oriented database that\
a. provides a Web API based on the REST principles\
b. transports data as JSON-encoded objects over HTTP/1.1 protocol and\
c. stores data as FSON-encoded objects (i.e. as FAST-encoded binary data with minimum amount of additional metadata).\

The project is implemented with C++20 using Clang 13 compiler.
